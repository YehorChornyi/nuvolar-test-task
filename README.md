## Task requirements

1. There must be a search bar to let the user search by username (login name)
2. After the search is completed, the application displays the list of users along with their avatar and their username on the same page. To simplify the exercise, in case there are too many results you can limit them at a certain maximum.
3. When a list item is clicked, the application navigates to a new page that displays a simple list with all the user details.
4. The new page will also display the list of the user’s repositories and followers.
5. The application has to be responsive and optimized for mobile
6. Documentation on how the application works and how to set up and build the project must be provided
7. Make sure that the application is production-ready.
8. The application reuses visual components across the app.
9. The application uses a solid-state management pattern across the app. The use of a state-management library (Redux, Akita,…) will be valued.
10. The search input does the searching as you type (See google search as an example)
11. There is an animated transition between pages
12. The application supports theming and can easily be switched between themes
13. The application style is built by one of the CSS preprocessors or CSS-in-JS
14. The application uses lazy-loading to load modules dynamically
15. Add a spinner meanwhile data is loading.
16. Create some basic Unit Testing
17. The application uses an Interceptor to catch the errors that might be happening whenever the API Call fails.
18. Use Reactive Forms to handle the interaction with the search bar.
19. The application uses ES6 standards.
